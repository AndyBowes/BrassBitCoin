A Block is made up of the following fields:

Yorkshire Block Chain
=====================

A block is defined as the following fields:

    index :int64
    minedBy: string
    data :  string
    previousHash : string
    nonce: int64
    hash : string

The hash is made by concating all the above fields (exluding the hash) in the above order with a single space between each value (see below).

The first block (the 'Genesis' block) is defined as:
    index = 0
    minedBy = "Genesis"
    data = "Genesis"
    previousHash = "0";
    nonce = 0
    hash = "F1A01423ACFBD25189F2FF6DC88075D703BAF23B7BA808F218FD7CC1615BFAFF"

So the concatinated block values used to generate the hash are:
"0 Genesis Genesis 0 0"
Which generates the following SHA256 hash value (which is converted to text in upper case):
F1A01423ACFBD25189F2FF6DC88075D703BAF23B7BA808F218FD7CC1615BFAFF

Subsiquent block must meet the following criteria:

index + 1 of the previous block
minedBy is the name of the block minder (your name / id)
data is any arbitary data to store in the block - (this would be any transactions in this block for bitcoin)
previousHash is the hash of the previous block
nonce (the nonsense number) a number which can be changed to make a valid hash (see below)
hash of the block starts with 5 zeros. If it is not valid, try another nonce value!
